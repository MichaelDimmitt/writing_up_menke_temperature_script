I am going to build it in ruby since it is calling a gem.
The bash script will be a seperate executable that is implemented by the ruby program.

1) write bash script
2) write ruby integration and gemfile.
3) other future thoughts.

### Intstallation Instructions:

gem install bundler
bundle install

bash mywatch.sh iStats
